                    <p>When man-eating Titans first appeared 100 years ago, humans found safety behind massive walls that stopped the
                        giants in their tracks. But the safety they have had for so long is threatened when a colossal Titan smashes through the barriers,
                        causing a flood of the giants into what had been the humans' safe zone. During the carnage that follows, soldier Eren Jaeger sees one of the creatures
                        devour his mother, which leads him to vow that he will kill every Titan. He enlists some friends who
                        survived to help him, and that group is humanity's last hope for avoiding extinction at the hands of the monsters.</p>
